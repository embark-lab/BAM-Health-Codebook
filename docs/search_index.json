A growing body of evidence indicates that anti-fat bias (i.e. negative ideologies, weight-based stereotypes, and discrimination based on weight and body size) and fatphobia (i.e. the internalized fear of fatness, weight gain, and fat bodies) are pervasive throughout Western society, contribute to poor health outcomes for individuals in larger bodies, and significantly impact healthcare access, quality, and equity.1–3 Further, weight-related biases in the healthcare system have a direct impact on patient health, as individuals in larger bodies are less likely to seek care4 and more likely to receive misdiagnosis and suboptimal treatment.2 Anti-fat bias can amplify other systemic biases and disparities in healthcare, as some minoritized groups, including African-American people, Hispanic-origin people, and sexual minority women, have elevated prevalence of high weight status in the United States.5,6 In addition to impacts on patients, anti-fat bias in the healthcare system can also adversely impact provider wellbeing.7 While detrimental effects of anti-fat bias on health equity, patient care, and provider wellbeing are well-documented, no large-scale programs have sought to challenge this bias amongst healthcare providers. The primary goal of the current project will be to evaluate the efficacy of a 4-session, group-based, peer-led intervention for healthcare students and professionals which aims to (1) build awareness of anti-fat bias in healthcare, (2) improve clinical competency on weight-related issues in patient encounters, (3) reduce anti-fat bias, (4) challenge internalized fatphobia, and (5) promote effective advocacy to challenge anti-fat bias in the larger healthcare context. 1.1 Specific Aims Validate a clinical vignette-based measure of anti-fat bias which includes selecting differential diagnoses and identifying contributing factors to disease in patients with varying weights. H1: Clinical vignettes will demonstrate good content validity following the application of recommended development protocols. Evaluate acceptability and feasibility of the Body Advocacy Movement intervention for medical students (BAM-Health). H2: BAM-Health will be both feasible and acceptable as an intervention. Estimate effects of BAM-Health on reducing anti-fat bias (1) in general and (2) in a clinical context. H3: Individuals in the BAM-Health condition will show reductions in general anti-fat bias, along with greater diagnostic accuracy and fewer biased attributions on clinical vignettes after completing the program. We expect larger effect sizes in the BAM vs. brochure control condition. Exploratory: Estimate effects of the BAM-Health intervention on health professional students’ own body satisfaction, internalized fatphobia, and overall mental health. "],["procedures.html", "Chapter 2 Procedures 2.1 Recruitment", " Chapter 2 Procedures We aim to enroll 100 health professional students at the University of Wisconsin (UW) over the course of 3 years (Each Summer; 2021-2023). Participants will be randomized to the BAM intervention (n = 50) or a control group (n = 50) that receives an educational pamphlet on ways to reduce anti-fat bias in clinical care. Participants in the BAM group will complete two peer-led, 2-hour sessions in which they will (1) Define anti-fat bias and fatphobia and explore how these constructs manifest in personal beliefs, interpersonal interactions, and in the healthcare setting, (2) Recognize and explore anti-fat bias in their personal and professional lives, (3) Learn new ways to challenge anti-fat bias in themselves, others, and future practice, and (4) Discuss ways to challenge anti-fat bias and weight stigma on an institutional and societal level with an emphasis on the healthcare system. While anti-fat bias is pervasive, we will specifically recruit medical students as they are early in clinical training, as existing biases may be less entrenched and more malleable in this population. 2.1 Recruitment Identified avenues for recruitment include: (1) posting on healthcare student listservs, (2) presenting the study at MD student interest groups, (3) student researchers involved with the project will provide study announcements in class listservs, (4) direct, peer-to-peer recruitment by MD and MD/MPH student researchers.

Dissonance-based prevention programs specifically aim to change internalized beliefs by asking participants to speak and act in ways that reject such beliefs. When individuals repeatedly speak and act in ways that contradict internalized beliefs, such beliefs are likely to shift to align with new patterns of behavior.16,18 In addition to dissonance, exposure is a relevant therapeutic mechanism specifically designed to challenge beliefs that are linked with feared outcomes.19,20 When engaging in exposure exercises, individuals act in ways that challenge fears in order to specifically test expectations regarding the likelihood of and/or their ability to emotionally manage feared outcomes, leading to reductions in both internalized fears and behavioral avoidance over time.19 S. 3.2.1 Session 1 Session 1 includes introductions, discussing identities and clarifying terminology, and an exercise in defining anti-fat bias and fatphobia and ways in which these biases present in the healthcare setting, discussion of how weight and health intersect in both personal and professional settings, and identification of ways individuals can uproot internalized fatphobia and anti-fat bias (e.g. diversifying social media feed and reading lists). Participants will choose one way to do this in the coming week. Participants are also asked to complete an imaginal exposure exercise at home where in which they will write and then recount several times during the week a ‘worst-case scenario’ of what they might fear could happen if they gained a significant amount of weight 3.2.2 Session 2 Session 2 will include a debrief of the homework and a series of role plays. In these role plays, peer facilitators will play the role of a friend, colleague, or patient in a situation that evokes anti-fat attitudes, and participants will practice challenging anti-fat attitudes. Participants will also identify ways to uproot anti-fat bias in the healthcare system and commit to engaging in one activity to do so in the coming week. They will also be asked to write a ‘response letter’ to their worst-case scenario as an exit exercise 3.3 Peer Facilitators We employ a peer-facilitated model of group intervention in this program, where a small group facilitators undergo an 12-hour training program, similar to Stice et al. (2017). Peer facilitators will train in teams – each peer-leader team will role-play delivery of the entire intervention and observed other peer leaders teams do the same, receiving live clinical supervision. 3.4 Intervention Fidelity Sessions will be audio recorded and reviewed by two members of research staff. Audio recorded sessions will be rated for fidelity and competence. Research staff will independently code a randomly selected sample of 50% of sessions for implementation fidelity and facilitator competence using checklists assessing the major exercises and discussion topics for each session. Each component will be rated for degree of accurate presentation (10-point scale from “No adherence; the section was skipped” to “Perfect; all material in the section was presented as written”). Facilitator competence will be rated using 12 items assessing indicators of competence (e.g., leaders express ideas clearly and at an appropriate pace, leaders attempt to allot equal speaking time for all members) on a 10-point scale.

The CTQ is a retrospective 28-item self-report inventory that measures the severity of different types of childhood trauma, producing five clinical subscales each comprised of five items: Emotional Abuse, Physical Abuse, Sexual Abuse, Emotional Neglect, Physical Neglect. The measure also includes a three-item Minimization/Denial scale indicating the potential underreporting of maltreatment. Participants respond to each item in the context of “when you were growing up” and answer according to a five-point Likert scale ranging from “never” = 1 to “very often” = 5, producing scores of 5 to 25 for each trauma subscale. The three items comprising the Minimization/Denial scale are dichotomized (“never” = 0, all other responses = 1) and summed; a total of one (1) or greater suggests the possible underreporting of maltreatment (false negatives). Scoring Scoring for the CTQ includes: Renaming variables with descriptive names Creating sum scores for each subscale (5 items for each of the 5 subscales) Dichotomizing items for the minimization scale Summing dichotimized items to create the minimization score Key Variables All variables below with appendix _25 reflect the final scoring of weighted subscale sum scores with &lt; 25% missing data. ctq_emo_abuse_25 ctq_phys_abuse_25 ctq_sex_abuse_25 ctq_emo_neglect_25 ctq_phys_neglect_25 ctq_minimize_complete (CTQ minimization score - completers only) 5.2 Demographics Demographics captured in the current study include: Race, Sexual Orientation, Gender, Ethnicity, Student Status, Working Status, Current Living Situation, Assessment Date, and Age Scoring Demographics are primarily drawn from the data collection form (measure prefix ‘dcf’).

(2013) to measure three dimensions of dieting: (1) frequency of past dieting and overeating (i.e. history of dieting), (2) current dieting to lose weight, and (3) weight suppression, or the difference between an individual’s current weight and his or her highest previous weight. Scoring Key Variables 5.4 ED History Questionnaire (EDHQ) The Eating Disorder History Questionnaire was developed by the EMBARK Lab for the current project to assess eating disorder history in the sample. It was used in baseline assessment for the current project prior to September, 2022, at which point the ED100k was substituted as it has been supported through initial validation for this purpose. The Eating Disorder History Questionnaire follows diagnostic algorithmic scoring to assess (via self-report) for history of eating disorder behaviors along with DSM-5 Anorexia Nervosa, Atypical Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, Binge Eating Disorder, and Subclinical Eating Pathology. Scoring Key Variables 5.5 Fat Phobia Scale - Short Form The shortened Fat Phobia Scale (FPS) utilizes 14 questions to assess fatphobia (from the 50-item original scale). It is intended to measure fat phobia levels in the tested population through various personality traits and whether there is bias when people apply them to an overweight person (Bacon et al. (2001)). The shortened FPS questionnaire demonstrates high reliability when compared to the original 50 question scale. The FPS uses a 5-point sliding scale with 1 being equal to a different negative descriptive variable for each respective question and 5 being equal to a different positive variable for each respective question. Some items are reverse scored prior to data aggregation such that th 1 (negative) to 5 (positive) valuation is maintained across the scale. Scoring Data Cleaning includes: 1-2. Selecting and renaming variables to include descriptive terms from questions in the scale. 3. Coding all items such that the negative descriptor is labeled as 1 and the positive descriptor is labeled as 5. 4. Computing a mean score using all 14-items Key Variables fps_mean (Mean score of all 14 items) 5.6 Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) (Spitzer et al., 2006) is a seven-item instrument that is used to measure or assess the severity of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). Each item asks the individual to rate the severity of his or her symptoms over the past two weeks. Response options include “not at all”, “several days”, “more than half the days” and “nearly every day”. The GAD-7 is a widely-used and well-validated measure for anxiety screening (Sapra et al., 2020). the GAD-7 is scored on a unidimensional scale summing all 7 items, with cutoffs that can also be employed for interpretation of clinical severity: | | Minimal anxiety = 0-4 | Mild Anxiety = 5-9 | Moderate Anxiety = 10-14 | Severe Anxiety = 15-21. | | A score of 10 points or higher indicates probably anxiety disorder, with 89% sensitivity and 82% specificity for GAD. Scoresheet Data Cleaning includes: 1-2 Selecting only the variables that are relevant for the current measure and recoding raw variables to make them consistent with the way of scoring: not at all = 0, several days =1, over half the days = 2, nearly every day =3 3-5 creation an additional variable based on sum scores reflecting the participant’s anxiety levels 6 creating a dichotomized measure of likely anxiety (cutoff score of 10 or greater), along with clinical severity index (minimal, mild, moderate, severe) Key variables gad_sum_25 (Sum of GAD-7, 25% or less items missing and weighted by N items completed) gad_cutoffs (GAD-7 with anxiety severity cutoffs employed) gad_anx_disorder (GAD-7 probable anxiety disorder Yes/No) 5.7 Goldfarb Fear of Fat Scale The Goldfarb Fear of Fat Scale (GFFS) is a 10-item scale which was introduced in 1985 as a diagnostic tool to measure one’s fear of fat as it can be an indicator for the development of an eating disorder (Goldfarb et al., 1985). When used as a screening tool for both clinical and non-clinical groups, GFFS has strong test-retest reliability and psychometric properties (Przybyta-Basista et al., 2022). In addition, the test also has shown high validity for both populations with and without eating disorders (Goldfarb, 2010) While original factor structure is defined as a single-factor, Przybyta-Basista et al. (2022) also supported a two-factor structure in a non-clinical sample: (1) fear of weight gain and (2) fear of losing control over eating/weight. GFFS uses a 4-point scale with 1 being equal to very untrue and 4 being equal to very true Scoring Data Cleaning includes: 1-2. Select and rename variables; recode labels scale to begin at 0 instead of 1 with very untrue being equal to 0 and very true being equal to 3. 3-4. Sum the total scores and create a variable to reflect only those completing &gt; 75% of items. Also create two subscales (FOWG and Fear of LOC) for alternative scoring. |Scoring Note Our GFFS scoring procedure re-scales the item scores to be 0-3 instead of 1-4, meaning that sum scores are scaled 0-21 instead of 7-28. To compare our means to other studies using the GFFS, add 7 to the sum score. Key Variables For variables below, _25 appendix reflects that individuals with &lt;25% missing items on a scale were included with weighted sums based on number of items completed gffs_sum_25 (sum of all items) gffs_fowg_25 (sum of fear of weight gain subscale) gffs_loc_25 (sum of loss of control items) 5.8 Ideal Body Stereotype Scale - Revised (IBSS-R) The Ideal Body Stereotype Scale - Revised (IBSS-R), is a brief (6-item), unidimensional scale designed to measure internalization of an ideal-body stereotype (specifically for women), developed by Stice et al. (1996). The IBSS-R has be utilized as a measure of thin-ideal internalization in eating disorder prevention research (Stice et al., 2019), making it suitable as a benchmark measure for existing effect sizes. Scoring Scoring includes: 1. Selecting and renaming variables. 2. Creating a mean score from all 6 IBSS items Key Variables ibss_mean_25 (Mean of all IBSS items, 25% or less missing) 5.9 Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire (SATAQ) The Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire-4 (SATAQ) is designed to assess societal and interpersonal aspects of appearance ideals. The SATAQ has five validated factors: Internalization of Thin/Low Body Fat, Internalization of Muscular/Athletic, Pressures from Family, Pressures from Media, and Pressures from Peers. This scale structure was confirmed in 3 independent and geographically diverse samples of women from the United States (East Coast N = 440, West Coast N = 304, and North/Midwest N = 349). SATAQ-4 scale scores demonstrated excellent reliability and good convergent validity with measures of body image, eating disturbance, and self-esteem. The measure was also validated in college males from the United States (N = 271); however, there was some evidence of an underlying structure unique to men. For the purposes of the current data, the 5-factor structure is employed in scoring. Scoresheet Cleaning Steps include: 1-3. Selecting raw variables being used and renaming variables to include numbering for order of questions in the scale; recoding labels scale to begin at 0 4. Generate total score and subscale scores:   Internalization of thinness/low Body Fat:   Internalization of muscular/athletic:   Pressures - family:   Pressures - peers:   Pressures - media: Key Variables Variables with the _25 appendix indicate that these variables include those with 25% or less missing data sataq_mean_25 (mean of SATAQ) sataq_thin_ideal_25 (mean of internalization of the thin ideal) sataq_athletic_ideal_25 (mean of internalization of athletic ideal) sataq_parental_pressure_25 (mean of parental pressure) sataq_peer_pressure_25 (mean of peer pressure) sataq_media_pressure_25 (mean of media pressure) 5.10 Universal Measure of Bias - Fat (UMB-fat) This companion file is for the Universal Measure of Bias - Fat (UMB-Fat) which was introduced in 2008 to assess weight bias and demonstrates strong psychometric properties when utilized as an assessment (Durso &amp; Latner, 2008). It has been compared alongside two other scales measuring universal bias against ‘gay’ or ‘Muslim’ individuals and demonstrates high internal consistency and construct validity (Latner et al., 2008). Further, higher BMI is not associated with any differences in weight bias. The UMB-Fat uses a 7-point likert scale with 1 being equal to strongly agree and 7 being equal to strongly disagree. In terms of scoring, sums of scores are separated amongst four categories of bias: adverse judgement, social distance, attraction, and equal rights. Scoring Data cleaning includes: 1. Selecting and renaming variables to include descriptors of questions asked in the scale 2. Reverse coding questions 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15, 16, and 19 so that higher scores indicate greater stigma 3. Creation of subscale scores: Sum the total scores of questions 5, 7, 12 ,15 , 16 = umb_adverse_judgement_sum Sum the total scores of questions 2, 8, 17, 19, 20 = umb_social_distance_sum Sum the total scores of questions 3, 4, 6, 9, 10 = umb_attraction_sum Sum the total scores of questions 1, 11, 13, 14, 18 = umb_equal_rights_sum Sum the total score with sum of all items as umb_sum_total Key Variables All variables below reflect the final scoring of subscale sum scores with &lt; 25% missing data (weighted sums used for those with any missing data). umb_adverse_judgement_sum_25 (adverse judgement against fat people) umb_social_distance_sum_25 (bias in the form of social distance from fat people) umb_attraction_sum_25 (bias in the form of attraction towards fat people) umb_equal_rights_sum_25 (bias in the form of opinons of equal rights for fat people) umb_sum_total_25 (sum of total umb-FAT scores - 25% or less missing) References "],["task-based-measures-1.html", "Chapter 6 Task-based Measures 6.1 Weight Implicit Association Test (Weight IAT) 6.2 Weight Based Approach Avoidance Task (Weight-AAT)", " Chapter 6 Task-based Measures 6.1 Weight Implicit Association Test (Weight IAT) Weight-IAT task data is housed in its own (long-format) data set within the study database, with keys of subject_id and timepoint. The Weight-IAT is a validated measure of automatic, unconscious attitudes that has previously been used to evaluate implicit weight-related biases (Phelan et al., 2014) The Weight-IAT compares the accuracy of, and time required to categorize images of larger-bodied and thinner people together with positively- and negatively-valanced words. Outcomes include reaction time and percentage of correct categorizations. 6.1.1 Scoring The IAT scoring algorithm involves several steps, with a rigorous scoring procedure involving 12 specifications (Greenwald et al., 2003) Steps include: Using data from Blocks 3,4,6, and 7 Eliminate trials with latencies &gt; 10,000 ms; eliminate subjects for whom more than 10% of trials have latency less than 300 ms Use all remaining trials No extreme-value treatment (beyond Step 2) Compute mean of correct latencies for each block Compute one pooled SD for all trials in blocks 3 &amp; 6; another for blocks 4 &amp; 7 Replace each error latency with block mean (computed in Step 5) + 600 ms No transformation Average the resulting values for each of the four blocks Compute two differences: B6 - B3 and B7 - B4 Divide each difference by its associated pooled- trials SD from Step 6 Average the two quotients from Step 11 R code used for cleaning Weight-IAT data prior to implementing the scoring algorithm is available here - not yet available. R code for completing the scoring algorithm with cleaned data is available here - not yet avaialble 6.1.2 Key Variables 6.2 Weight Based Approach Avoidance Task (Weight-AAT) An interactive task will manipulate congruency between reward- and threat-related outcomes – a task derived from Weaver et al. (2020). Participants learn, through trial-and-error, which of three responses, indicated as geometric shapes, to select to achieve a particular outcome. Critically, each response option is associated with a probability of both a reward outcome (points) and an additional outcome (i.e., images of body parts of those in larger bodies). The response-outcome contingencies (e.g., which option is most likely to lead to reward) switch throughout the task, such that half the time the option that is most likely to lead to reward is also most likely to lead to seeing large body images (Conflict Phase), and half the time the highest reward option is least likely to lead to seeing large body images (Congruent Phase) . Participants are instructed to earn as many points as possible (reward goals), allowing us to test biases in decision-making when large body images are likely. In each trial, participants would choose a shape, and, after a delay (.5-.75s), the point outcome for that trial appeared under the image (presented for 1.5–2.5s) while the image remained on screen, indicating a positive or negative value (e.g., +5 or -7). Trials were separated by a fixation cross, presented for .5-1.5s. The type of image (trauma-related or neutral) and the direction of points (positive, negative) were experimentally manipulated to reflect probabilities that aligned with the type of phase. The number of points won/lost was randomly generated (range: 1-10). Task Phases were not counterbalanced in order to allow for initial task structure learning before the introduction to the Conflict Phase. On all trials, both outcomes (image type, point win/loss) had either an 80%, 50%, or 20% chance of occurring. The image type and point win/loss probabilities were independent from one another. Probabilities for each outcome for the left and right shape (circle and hexagon) were adjusted throughout the task to create the Conflict and Congruent Phases. 6.2.1 Scoring 6.2.1.1 Difference Score We can also create a crude individual difference score to represent discrepancy between the two task phases (Mean Conflict Phase points - Mean Congruent Phase Points), with higher difference score reflecting a higher degree of conflict between the two phases. 6.2.1.2 Linear Mixed Effects Model Code for scoring the Weight-AAT using a Linear mixed Effects Model Approach is available here - not yet available Weight-AAT task data is housed in its own (long-format) data set within the study database, with keys of subject_id and timepoint. The Linear Mixed Effects Model uses trial-wise outcomes (i.e. modeling outcomes on all trials for each participant). Prior to analysis, predictors and outcomes are scaled for analysis including block, Phase (Conflict = -1, Congruent - 1), and Trial (z-scored within each block) and regressed on Total Points (scaled from 0 to 1). Trial is coded to account for learning within block (e.g. trial number 1-25 z-scored to represent linear learning throughout a trial). Ultimate outputs of this model would include a random intercept and random slope for Phase, Block, Trial, and their interactions to account for individual variability – e.g: Points ~ Phase + Trial + Block + Phase * Trial + Phase * Block + Trial * Block + Phase * Trial * Block + Age + Gender + (1+Phase * Trial * Block|sub) To examine BMI differences, a Phase * BMI and Phase * Trial * BMI interaction may also be introduced to the model 6.2.1.3 Drift Diffusion Modeling xxx 6.2.2 Key Variables aat_difference_score : Difference between points obtained during the conflict phases vs. congruent phases of the task aat_phase : Trial Phase (Conflict = -1, Congruent = 1) References "],["sample-description.html", "Chapter 7 Sample Description", " Chapter 7 Sample Description "],["data-requests-and-terms-of-use.html", "Chapter 8 Data Requests and Terms of Use", " Chapter 8 Data Requests and Terms of Use We aim to share data from the BAM project will all interested parties.
